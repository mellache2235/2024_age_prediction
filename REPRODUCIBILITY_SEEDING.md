# Reproducibility: Random Seeding Implementation

## Overview

All optimization scripts now use **consistent random seeding** to ensure reproducible results across runs.

---

## Random Seed Used

**Seed value**: `42`

This seed is used throughout all scripts:
- `optimized_brain_behavior_core.py`
- `run_stanford_asd_brain_behavior_optimized.py`
- `run_abide_asd_brain_behavior_optimized.py`
- `run_nki_brain_behavior_optimized.py`
- `run_all_cohorts_brain_behavior_optimized.py`

---

## What Gets Seeded

### 1. Cross-Validation Splits
```python
RANDOM_SEED = 42

outer_cv = KFold(n_splits=5, shuffle=True, random_state=RANDOM_SEED)
```

**Effect**: Same train/test splits every run  
**Ensures**: Consistent CV scores across runs

### 2. NumPy Random State
```python
np.random.seed(RANDOM_SEED)
```

**Effect**: Any numpy random operations are consistent  
**Ensures**: Reproducible behavior in optimization

### 3. Model Fitting
The random_state propagates through sklearn pipelines, affecting:
- PCA initialization (if randomized)
- Cross-validation splits
- Any internal randomization in models

---

## Reproducibility Guarantee

### Same Input → Same Output

Running the same script twice will produce:
- ✅ Same CV splits
- ✅ Same CV scores
- ✅ Same best configuration selected
- ✅ Same final Spearman ρ
- ✅ Same predictions (exact same values)

### Example:

**Run 1**:
```
Optimizing social_awareness_tscore... (seed=42)
Best: FeatureSelection+Lasso (ρ=0.0964)
Final: ρ = 0.293, p = 0.0033
```

**Run 2** (same data, same script):
```
Optimizing social_awareness_tscore... (seed=42)
Best: FeatureSelection+Lasso (ρ=0.0964)  ← Identical!
Final: ρ = 0.293, p = 0.0033              ← Identical!
```

## Implementation Details

### In Core Module (`optimized_brain_behavior_core.py`):

```python
# Global seed constant
RANDOM_SEED = 42

def optimize_comprehensive(X, y, measure_name, verbose=True, random_seed=None):
    if random_seed is None:
        random_seed = RANDOM_SEED
    
    # Set numpy seed
    np.random.seed(random_seed)
    
    # Use seed in CV
    outer_cv = KFold(n_splits=5, shuffle=True, random_state=random_seed)
    
    # ... rest of optimization
```

### In Each Script:

```python
# At top
RANDOM_SEED = 42

# In analysis function
np.random.seed(RANDOM_SEED)

# Pass to optimization
optimize_comprehensive(..., random_seed=RANDOM_SEED)
```

---

## Verification

### To verify reproducibility:

```bash
# Run 1
python run_stanford_asd_brain_behavior_optimized.py > run1.log 2>&1

# Run 2
python run_stanford_asd_brain_behavior_optimized.py > run2.log 2>&1

# Compare results
diff <(grep "Final_Spearman" run1.log) <(grep "Final_Spearman" run2.log)
# Should show no differences!
```

---

## Benefits

### 1. Reproducibility
- Same results every time (for same data)
- Critical for scientific reproducibility
- Reviewers can verify your results

### 2. Debugging
- If you get an error, it will happen consistently
- Easier to debug and fix

### 3. Comparison
- Can compare different preprocessing approaches
- Know that differences aren't due to random variation

### 4. Publication
- Meets reproducibility standards
- Can include in methods: "Random seed 42 was used for all cross-validation splits"

---

## In Methods Section (For Publication)

Add to your methods:

> "To ensure reproducibility, all analyses used a fixed random seed (42) for 
> cross-validation splits and model fitting. This allows exact replication of 
> results given the same input data."

---

## Changing the Seed (Optional)

If you want to use a different seed:

### Option 1: Change globally
Edit the seed in each script:
```python
RANDOM_SEED = 12345  # Your choice
```

### Option 2: Add command-line option
```bash
python run_stanford_asd_brain_behavior_optimized.py --seed 12345
```

(Would need to add argparse argument)

---

## What Remains Stochastic?

### Still Variable:
- Order of warnings (parallel processing)
- Exact timing
- Console output formatting

### Always Identical:
- CV fold assignments
- Model parameters
- Final predictions
- Spearman correlations
- R² values
- All numerical results
