# Top-K IG Features Strategy - NEW Optimization Approach

## 🎯 Purpose

A new optimization strategy specifically designed for **small sample sizes** that leverages the interpretability of Integrated Gradient (IG) scores to avoid overfitting.

## Problem It Solves

### The Challenge:
With small sample sizes (e.g., NKI with N=81), traditional approaches fail:

```
N=81 subjects, 246 ROI features → 3:1 feature-to-sample ratio
Result: Severe overfitting, model collapse, constant predictions
```

### The Solution:
**Use IG scores to select only the most important features**, creating a much better ratio:

```
N=81 subjects, 8 top ROIs → 10:1 subject-to-feature ratio
Result: Better generalization, interpretable models
```

## How It Works

### 1. **Adaptive K Selection** Based on Sample Size

```python
if n_samples < 100:
    # Very small N (like NKI): use N/15, N/10, N/8
    k_values = [5, 8, 10]  # For N=81
    
elif n_samples < 200:
    # Small N: use N/10, N/8, N/5
    k_values = [15, 18, 25]  # For N=150
    
else:
    # Larger N: can use more features
    k_values = [20, 30, 50, 100]
```

### 2. **Feature Selection by IG Importance**

```python
# Calculate mean absolute IG score per ROI
feature_importance = np.abs(X).mean(axis=0)

# Select top K ROIs
top_k_idx = np.argsort(feature_importance)[-k:]
```

**Why this works**: IG scores already tell you which brain regions are most important for age prediction. These same regions are likely relevant for brain-behavior relationships.

### 3. **Simple Models**

Tests Linear, Ridge, and Lasso regression on the selected features:
- **Linear**: When signal is strong
- **Ridge**: Mild regularization
- **Lasso**: Can further sparsify if needed

## Integration

### Automatic for All Optimized Scripts ✅

The strategy is now **automatically included** in all scripts using `optimize_comprehensive()`:

- ✅ `run_all_cohorts_brain_behavior_optimized.py`
- ✅ `run_nki_brain_behavior_optimized.py`  
- ✅ `run_stanford_asd_brain_behavior_optimized.py`
- ✅ `run_abide_asd_brain_behavior_optimized.py`
- ✅ All other optimized scripts

No code changes needed - just run your analysis!

## Expected Results

### For NKI (N=81):

**Before (PCA/PLS on 246 features):**
```
Spearman ρ = -0.061
R² = -39.4
Predictions: constant (55.03 for everyone)
Status: ❌ Model collapse
```

**After (Top-8 IG features):**
```
Spearman ρ = 0.15-0.35  ← Expected improvement
R² = 0.02-0.12
Predictions: Variable
Status: ✓ Actual predictions (though modest due to small N)
```

### Benefits:

1. **Better subject-to-feature ratio**
   - Old: 1:3 (terrible)
   - New: 10:1 (acceptable)

2. **Interpretable**
   - "These 8 ROIs, most important for age, also predict behavior"
   - Can map to brain networks/regions

3. **Leverages IG information**
   - Don't throw away what you already know
   - Use age-prediction insights for behavior

4. **Avoids model collapse**
   - Predictions have meaningful variance
   - Models can actually learn patterns

## Example Output

When this strategy wins, you'll see:

```
====================================================================================================
BEST PERFORMANCES (Sorted by Spearman ρ)
====================================================================================================
       Measure  Final_Spearman  P_Display  Best_Strategy Best_Model
  Inattention        0.284       0.0127      TopK-IG       Ridge
Hyperactivity        0.312       0.0053      TopK-IG       Linear


HIGHEST CORRELATION: ρ = 0.312, p = 0.0053
Measure: Hyperactivity
Strategy: TopK-IG (K=8 features)
```

In the optimization results CSV:
```
strategy: TopK-IG
n_features: 8
feature_selection: MeanAbsValue
model: Ridge
alpha: 0.1
```

## When This Strategy Wins

### Most Likely to Win:
- ✅ **Small N** (N < 100)
- ✅ **Many features** (P >> N)
- ✅ **IG scores available** (always true for your analyses)
- ✅ **Clear feature importance** (some ROIs much stronger than others)

### May Not Win:
- ❌ **Large N** (N > 200): PCA/PLS can handle more complexity
- ❌ **Weak signals**: If no ROIs are particularly important
- ❌ **Distributed effects**: If all ROIs contribute equally

## Technical Details

### Feature Selection Method:
```python
# Mean absolute value across subjects
feature_importance = np.abs(X).mean(axis=0)
```

This assumes **IG scores** where:
- Larger absolute values = more important for prediction
- Sign may vary by subject but magnitude is key
- Averaging abs() gives overall importance

### K Value Determination:
Conservative approach following statistical best practices:
- **N/15**: Most conservative (N=81 → K=5)
- **N/10**: Standard rule of thumb (N=81 → K=8)  
- **N/8**: Slightly more aggressive (N=81 → K=10)

Tests all three, picks best via CV.

### Cross-Validation:
- 5-fold CV for performance evaluation
- Feature selection done INSIDE each fold (no data leakage)
- Spearman correlation as metric (robust to outliers)

## Limitations

1. **Still requires some minimal N**
   - Need at least N > 30 for reliable estimates
   - With N < 50, any result should be interpreted cautiously

2. **Assumes IG importance is relevant**
   - IG scores tell you importance for AGE
   - Behavior relationships may differ
   - But: age-related regions often behaviorally relevant

3. **May miss distributed effects**
   - Selects top K individual features
   - If signal is spread across many weak features, may miss it
   - PCA/PLS can capture distributed patterns better

4. **Cannot overcome fundamental limitations**
   - With N=81, even perfect feature selection has limits
   - Some measures may genuinely not be predictable
   - Small correlations may not be reliable

## Comparison to Other Strategies

| Strategy | N=81 Suitable? | Interpretability | Avoids Overfitting? |
|----------|----------------|------------------|---------------------|
| PCA (20 comp) | ⚠️ Marginal | ❌ Low | ⚠️ Some risk |
| PLS | ⚠️ Marginal | ❌ Low | ⚠️ Some risk |
| Feature Selection (50) | ❌ No | ✓ Medium | ❌ High risk |
| Direct Ridge/Lasso | ❌ No | ✓ High | ⚠️ Heavy regularization needed |
| **TopK-IG (8)** | ✅ **Yes** | ✅ **High** | ✅ **Best** |

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements (not yet implemented):

1. **Network-level aggregation**: Aggregate 246 ROIs → 7 Yeo networks before top-K
2. **Stability selection**: Select features stable across CV folds
3. **Hierarchical selection**: Select networks, then ROIs within
4. **Correlation filtering**: Remove highly correlated features before selection

## Usage

Just run your optimized scripts as normal:

```bash
# Automatically includes Top-K IG strategy
python run_nki_brain_behavior_optimized.py
python run_all_cohorts_brain_behavior_optimized.py --cohort nki_rs_td
```

The strategy will be tested alongside all others and used if it performs best!
