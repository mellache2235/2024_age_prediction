# Brain-Behavior Optimization Guide

## 🎯 Goal
Maximize Spearman correlations between brain features (IG scores) and behavioral measures using comprehensive hyperparameter optimization.

---

## 📋 Step-by-Step Workflow

### Step 1: Run Optimization

Choose the appropriate script for your cohort:

#### Dedicated Scripts (Recommended):
```bash
# Stanford ASD (SRS measures)
python scripts/run_stanford_asd_brain_behavior_optimized.py

# ABIDE ASD (ADOS measures)
python scripts/run_abide_asd_brain_behavior_optimized.py

# NKI (CAARS/Conners measures)
python scripts/run_nki_brain_behavior_optimized.py
```

#### Universal Script (ADHD cohorts):
```bash
# ADHD200 or CMI-HBN
python scripts/run_all_cohorts_brain_behavior_optimized.py --cohort adhd200_td
python scripts/run_all_cohorts_brain_behavior_optimized.py --cohort adhd200_adhd
python scripts/run_all_cohorts_brain_behavior_optimized.py --cohort cmihbn_td
python scripts/run_all_cohorts_brain_behavior_optimized.py --cohort cmihbn_adhd
```

**Test mode** (2 measures, ~5 min):
```bash
python scripts/run_stanford_asd_brain_behavior_optimized.py --max-measures 2
```

**Runtime**: 30-60 minutes for full analysis

---

### Step 2: What Happens During Optimization

For each behavioral measure, the script:

1. **Loads data** (IG features + behavioral scores)
2. **Removes outliers** (IQR × 3 method)
3. **Tests ~100-200 configurations**:
   - PCA + Regression (5-50 components × 4 models × 7 alphas)
   - PLS Regression (3-30 components)
   - Feature Selection + Regression (4 feature counts × 2 methods)
   - Direct Regularized Regression (7 alphas)
4. **Uses 5-fold cross-validation** for each config
5. **Selects best configuration** (highest CV Spearman ρ)
6. **Refits best model on ALL data**
7. **Evaluates and saves results**

**Expected warnings**: `SpearmanRConstantInputWarning` (20-50 times) - NORMAL! Bad configs being tested and rejected.

### Step 3: Review Console Output

For each behavioral measure, you'll see:

```
====================================================================================================
  ANALYZING: social_awareness_tscore
====================================================================================================

  Valid subjects: 99
  
  Optimizing social_awareness_tscore...
    Best: FeatureSelection+Lasso (ρ=0.0964)  ← CV score

📊 PREDICTION INTEGRITY CHECK:
================================================================================

Actual values:
  N = 99
  Mean = 65.23, Std = 12.45, Range = [42.00, 95.00]

Predicted values:
  Mean = 64.87, Std = 11.98, Range = [45.12, 88.34]

Metrics:
  Spearman ρ = 0.293    ← Final score (on all data)
  P-value = 0.0033      ← Significance
  R² = 0.095
  MAE = 5.26

✅ No major issues detected  ← GOOD! Use this result

Sample predictions (first 5):
    Actual  Predicted   Residual
     65.20      63.40       1.80
     72.10      74.30      -2.20
     58.90      60.10      -1.20
     81.50      79.20       2.30
     55.00      57.80      -2.80
================================================================================

✓ Saved: scatter_social_awareness_tscore_FeatureSelection_Lasso_k50_optimized.png
```

**Key things to check**:
- ✅ or ❌ in integrity check
- Spearman ρ and p-value
- Prediction range (should be reasonable, not [-1000, 2000])

---

### Step 4: Files Produced

For each cohort, in `/oak/.../brain_behavior/{cohort}_optimized/`:

#### Summary Files:
- **`optimization_summary.csv`** - Best configuration for each measure
  ```csv
  Measure,N_Subjects,Best_Strategy,Best_Model,CV_Spearman,Final_Spearman,Final_P_Value,Final_R2
  social_awareness_tscore,99,FeatureSelection+Lasso,Lasso,0.096,0.293,0.0033,0.095
  ```

#### Per-Measure Files:
- **`scatter_{measure}_{method}_{params}_optimized.png/tiff/ai`** - Scatter plot
  - Example: `scatter_social_awareness_tscore_FeatureSelection_Lasso_k50_optimized.png`
  - Shows: r = 0.293, p = 0.0033, model info
  
- **`predictions_{measure}_{method}.csv`** - Actual vs predicted values
  ```csv
  Actual,Predicted,Residual
  65.20,63.40,1.80
  72.10,74.30,-2.20
  ...
  ```

- **`optimization_results_{measure}.csv`** - All ~200 configurations tested
  ```csv
  strategy,model,n_components,alpha,mean_cv_spearman,std_cv_spearman
  FeatureSelection+Lasso,Lasso,,0.1,0.0964,0.0234
  PLS,PLS,15,,0.0893,0.0198
  ...
  ```

---

### Step 5: Identify Good Results

#### Option 1: Check Console Output
Look for:
- ✅ **"No major issues detected"** → Use this result
- ❌ **"ISSUES DETECTED"** → Don't use

#### Option 2: Use Summary Script
```bash
python scripts/create_optimization_summary_figure.py --cohort stanford_asd --min-rho 0.2
```

**Produces**:
- `{cohort}_optimization_summary_significant.csv` - Only good results
- `{cohort}_correlations_barplot.png` - Visual summary
- `{cohort}_optimization_summary_figure.png` - Multi-panel figure

**Automatically filters out**:
- Failed models (extreme R²)
- Non-significant results (p > 0.05)
- Weak correlations (|ρ| < threshold)

---

## 📊 Interpreting Results

```

**What to do**:
- ✗ Don't use this result
- ✗ Don't include in publication
- ✓ Note: "No significant brain-behavior correlation found for this measure"

## 🔍 Optimization Details

### What Gets Tested (~200 configurations):

| Strategy | Configurations |
|----------|----------------|
| **PCA + Linear** | 10 PC values = 10 configs |
| **PCA + Ridge** | 10 PC × 7 alphas = 70 configs |
| **PCA + Lasso** | 10 PC × 7 alphas = 70 configs |
| **PCA + ElasticNet** | 10 PC × 7 alphas = 70 configs |
| **PLS** | 10 component values = 10 configs |
| **Feature Selection + Ridge/Lasso** | 2 methods × 4 K × 2 models × 4 alphas = 64 configs |
| **Direct Ridge/Lasso/ElasticNet** | 3 models × 7 alphas = 21 configs |
| **Total** | ~315 configurations |

### How Selection Works:
- Each config evaluated with 5-fold cross-validation
- **Spearman correlation** is the metric being maximized
- Best config (highest CV Spearman) is selected
- Best model refitted on ALL data
- Final performance reported

---

## 📈 Expected Performance

### Baseline (Enhanced Scripts):
- Uses: PCA (80% variance) + LinearRegression
- Example NKI: ρ = 0.35 - 0.41

### Optimized (Should Achieve):
- Tests: All strategies above
- Expected: ρ = baseline to +30%
- Example NKI: ρ = 0.41 - 0.50

**If optimized ≈ baseline**: LinearRegression was already optimal!  
**If optimized > baseline (+10-30%)**: PLS or other strategy worked better!

## 🚨 Common Issues

### Issue: "Per-column arrays must be 1-dimensional"
**Cause**: Running old code on Oak  
**Solution**: Ensure latest code is synced/cloned to Oak

### Issue: Many SpearmanRConstantInputWarnings
**Status**: **NORMAL!** ✅ Part of testing ~200 configs  
**Action**: None needed - bad configs auto-rejected

### Issue: Poor performance (ρ much worse than baseline)
**Causes**:
1. No real brain-behavior relationship (expected for some measures)
2. Data mismatch (wrong subjects loaded)
3. Old code on Oak (sync issue)

**Check**: Integrity output should show reasonable prediction ranges
