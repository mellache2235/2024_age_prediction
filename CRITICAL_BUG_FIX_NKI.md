# CRITICAL BUG FIX: NKI Optimization Performance Issue

## üêõ Problem Identified

**Symptom**: NKI optimized script produces terrible results (œÅ = -0.06) while enhanced script gets good results (œÅ = 0.35-0.41)

**Root Cause**: **DATA MISALIGNMENT**

---

## The Bug

### In NKI Optimized Script (WRONG):

```python
# Line ~265: Load ALL IG data (369 subjects)
subject_ids_ig, ig_matrix, ig_cols = load_ig_scores()  # 369 subjects

# Line ~270: Merge with behavioral (369 common subjects)
merged_df = merge_data(ig_df_full, behavioral_df)  # 369 subjects

# Line ~295: Get behavioral scores from merged df
behavioral_scores = merged_df[measure].values  # 369 values

# Line ~298-299: BUG! Using WRONG X matrix
X = ig_matrix  # ‚Üê WRONG! This is for ALL 369 IG subjects
y = behavioral_scores  # ‚Üê This is for 369 MERGED subjects

# These don't align properly!
```

**Problem**: `ig_matrix` and `behavioral_scores` come from different sources and may not align!

---

## The Fix

### Correct Approach (Like Enhanced Script):

```python
# Line ~265: Load ALL IG data
subject_ids_ig, ig_matrix, ig_cols = load_ig_scores()

# Line ~270: Merge
merged_df = merge_data(ig_df_full, behavioral_df)  # 369 subjects with BOTH

# CRITICAL FIX: Extract IG matrix from MERGED dataframe
X_merged = merged_df[ig_cols].values  # ‚Üê CORRECT! From merged df

# Then for each measure:
X = X_merged  # ‚Üê Use merged IG matrix
y = merged_df[measure].values  # ‚Üê Use merged behavioral scores
# Now X and y are guaranteed to align!
```

---

## Why This Caused Terrible Results

### Scenario:

**Original ig_matrix** (369 subjects):
```
Subject 001: [brain features]
Subject 002: [brain features]
...
Subject 369: [brain features]
```

**merged_df behavioral scores** (369 subjects, but different order or subset):
```
Subject 003: behavior = 5
Subject 001: behavior = 8
...
```

**Result**: Features from Subject 001 paired with behavior from Subject 003 ‚Üí Random noise!

### Predictions Go Wild:
- Actual range: [0-12]
- Predicted range: [-29 to +38] ‚Üê Completely wrong!
- R¬≤ = -39 ‚Üê Severe overfitting
- œÅ = -0.06 ‚Üê No correlation

---

## Verification After Fix

### Before Fix (WRONG):
```python
X = ig_matrix  # From load_ig_scores() - all subjects
y = behavioral_scores  # From merged_df - potentially different order
```

### After Fix (CORRECT):
```python
X_merged = merged_df[ig_cols].values  # ‚Üê From merged df
X = X_merged  # ‚Üê Use merged matrix
y = merged_df[measure].values  # ‚Üê From same merged df
# Both from same dataframe ‚Üí guaranteed alignment!
```

---

## Expected Results After Fix

### Enhanced Script (Baseline):
```
N subjects: 81
Spearman œÅ = 0.353-0.410
R¬≤ = 0.14-0.23
Predictions: reasonable range
```

### Optimized Script (Should Now Match or Beat):
```
N subjects: 81  ‚Üê Same!
Spearman œÅ = 0.35-0.50  ‚Üê Should be ‚â• baseline
R¬≤ = 0.14-0.25  ‚Üê Reasonable
Predictions: reasonable range
‚úÖ No major issues detected
```

---

## The Fix Applied

**File**: `run_nki_brain_behavior_optimized.py`

**Change**: Lines ~273-299

Added:
```python
# Extract IG matrix from MERGED dataframe (not original)
X_merged = merged_df[ig_cols].values

# Then use X_merged for analysis
X = X_merged
y = behavioral_scores
```

---

## Why This Bug Happened

The optimized script was created from scratch, while enhanced script evolved over time with testing.

**Enhanced script flow** (correct):
1. Load IG
2. Load behavioral
3. Merge
4. Extract IG matrix **from merged df**

**Optimized script flow** (was wrong):
1. Load IG (keep matrix)
2. Load behavioral
3. Merge
4. Use **original** IG matrix (bug!)

**Now fixed** to match enhanced script! ‚úÖ

## Testing After Fix

```bash
# Should now work
python run_nki_brain_behavior_optimized.py --max-measures 2
```

**Expected**:
```
Optimizing B T-SCORE (HYPERACTIVITY)...
  Best: PLS (œÅ=0.42)  ‚Üê Good CV score!

Final Metrics:
  Spearman œÅ = 0.43  ‚Üê Should be ‚â• 0.41 (baseline)
  P-value < 0.001
  R¬≤ = 0.18
  
‚úÖ No major issues detected

Predictions reasonable range!
```

**Status**: ‚úÖ CRITICAL BUG FIXED  
**Cause**: Data misalignment  
**Fix**: Use IG matrix from merged dataframe  
**Expected**: Now should match or beat enhanced script performance
